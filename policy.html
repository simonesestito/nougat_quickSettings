            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Simone Sestito ("developer") built the Quick Settings app as an Ad Supported and Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by the developer at no cost and is intended for use as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
            </p>
            <p style="background: rgba(110, 110, 0, 0.6); /* color: white; */ text-align: center;"><b>I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. </b></p>
            <p>The app also doesn't directly use any analytics library, so the developer cannot see any usage data, apart from the ones provided by Google Play Store as for every app.</p>
            <p>
                The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Quick Settings unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
