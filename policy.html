      <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
      <p>
        I want to inform you that whenever you
        use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
        I collect data and information (through third party
        products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
        include information such as your device Internet Protocol
        (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
        configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
        statistics.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
        to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
        the app may use third party code and libraries that use
        “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

        and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

        portions of this Service.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
      <p>
        I may employ third-party companies and
        individuals due to the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>

      <p>
        I want to inform users of this Service
        that these third parties have access to your Personal
        Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
        them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
      <p>
        I value your trust in providing us your
        Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
        storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
        a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
        that these external sites are not operated by me.

        me with personal information, I immediately
        delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
        and you are aware that your child has provided us with
        personal information, please contact me so that
        I will be able to do necessary actions.

      <h2>Terms &amp; conditions</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
        automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
        allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
        our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
        to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
        versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
        database rights and other intellectual property rights related
        to it, still belong to Simone Sestito.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simone Sestito is committed to ensuring that the app is
        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Quick Settings app stores and processes personal data that
        you have provided to us, in order to provide my
        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
        that the Quick Settings app won’t work properly or at all.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          The app does use third party services that declare their own
          Terms and Conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service
          providers used by the app
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that
        Simone Sestito will not take responsibility for. Certain
        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
        by your mobile network provider, but Simone Sestito
        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
        have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
        should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
        other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, Simone Sestito cannot always take
        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
        Simone Sestito cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to Simone Sestito’s responsibility for your
        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to you. Simone Sestito accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
        currently available on Android – the requirements for
        system(and for any additional systems we
        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
        using the app. Simone Sestito does not promise that it
        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
        and/or works with the Android version that you have
        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
        from your device.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
      <p>
        I may update our Terms and Conditions
        from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will
        notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
        Conditions on this page.
